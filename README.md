# AppStage

## Description

AppStage performs the automatic installation and configuration of the software stack that constitutes an application environment. With AppStage you can easily define software configurations for your virtual machines and share them with other users.

Installing and configuring applications is a laborious task. Nowadays, there are several Configuration Management tools like [chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/), [puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/what-is-puppet/) or [cfengine](http://cfengine.com/) that allow to script the installation and configuration of applications and services.

AppStage helps you to integrate these tools and automation processes with an OpenNebula IaaS cloud, by:

* Managing software stacks configurations (environment). So cloud users can instantiate an environment rather than just a VM.
* Providing the required scripting glue to seamlessly integrate chef with the powerful OpenNebula's contextualization process.

AppStage uses [chef-solo](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Solo) to power the automatic installation and configuration of the app software stack.
